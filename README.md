# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs where code is organized into objects.
Each object represents a real-world thing and contains data (variables) and actions (functions/methods) together.

In one line:

OOP = data + functions bundled together as objects
